Arbitrary arity trees, also known as n-ary trees, are trees where each node can have a variable number of children, as opposed to binary trees where each node has at most two children. In these trees, nodes can have anywhere from zero to an unlimited number of children, providing a flexible structure for representing hierarchical data.

## Definition
An arbitrary arity tree is a data structure consisting of nodes where:

* Root Node: The topmost node with no parent.
* Child Nodes: Nodes connected to a given node. Each node can have any number of child nodes.
* Leaf Nodes: Nodes with no children.
* Internal Nodes: Nodes that have at least one child.

## Motivation
Arbitrary arity trees are used in a variety of applications due to their flexibility and adaptability in representing complex data structures. They are suitable for modeling data with natural hierarchies, such as organizational structures, file systems, or family trees.
