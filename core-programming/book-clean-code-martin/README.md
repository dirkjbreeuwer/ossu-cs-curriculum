# Book: Clean code by Robert C. Martin

## Chapter 1 - Clean code

* Bad code increases complexity and reduces productivity.
* Adding extra hands to the team to help increase productivity can make matters worse, and they are unfamiliar with the intent of the design, have pressure to increase productivity and make even more bad code.

## Chapter 2 - Meaningful names

### Use intention-revealing names

* Choose names that explicitly reveal their purpose, significance, contents.

```Java
// A bad choice
int d ; //elapsed time in days

// A better choice
int elapsedTimeInDays ; 
```

### Avoid disinformation

* Do not refer to a grouping of elements to as a list, unless its actually a `List`. For example instead of `accountList`, use a simple `accounts`.

### Make meaningful distinctions

*
