# Core Programming: How to Code: Simple Data

Part of [UBCx's Software Development MicroMasters Program](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ubcx-software-development). This course teaches you how to write well-tested and easy to improve programms.

## Learning outcomes

* How to represent information as data
* How to focus each part of your program on a single task
* How to use examples and tests to clarify what your program should do
* How to simplify the structure of your program using common patterns
Recognize and represent more complicated information
